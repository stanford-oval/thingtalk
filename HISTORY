1.5.1
=====

* Fix tarball again, missing generated files

1.5.0
=====

* BREAKING CHANGE: the SentenceGenerator module, and the associated template files, have been moved
  to [genie-toolkit](https://github.com/Stanford-Mobisocial-IoT-Lab/genie-toolkit),
  and they are not in the library anymore.
* The NN syntax definition was redone to make it easier to extend, with a custom
  domain-specific language and the ability to generate a Python parser as well.
* The formatter now supports missing or invalid parameters, and will automatically
  display only the available information. In the future, this will allow for projections
  on notifications.
* Minor bug fixes and code style improvements [#68]

1.4.2
=====

* Updated messaging interface to work with the latest version of thingengine-core [#67].
* Fixed syntax of argmin/argmax [#62].
* Misc bug fixes.
* Dependencies have been updated [#61].
* Build system and CI fixes.

1.4.1
=====

* Fix botched tarball in previous release, missing important files

1.4.0
=====

* New feature: aggregations and argmin/argmax are now fully implemented, including
  the compiler and runtime parts [#56, #57, #60]
* New module: SentenceGenerator; used to generate programs and their associated sentences.
  The generator uses a new DSL, dubbed yasgg (Yet Another Sentence Generator Generator,
  a reference to the well-known parser generator YACC).
  This module is epxerimental and expected to change in the future.
* Internal modules have been reorganized.
* Misc bug fixes [#47, #55, #58].
* Dependencies have been updated [#54].

1.3.1
=====

* Misc bug fixes

1.3.0
=====

* New Class syntax to replace Thingpedia manifests.
* New syntax on queries to indicate whether they are monitorable and/or lists.
* New language component: mixins and import statements.
* New language component: dataset and examples; these replace the use of declarations
  for composable code snippets in Thingpedia.
* New language component: annotations; these can be applied to function declarations
  in classes, to classes themselves, and to examples in datasets.
* Minor API changes in the Ast module. Ast API is still considered experimental and
  is not covered by the API stability promise.
* The API of SchemaRetriever has changed significantly, following the changes in
  the upstream Thingpedia API.
* The syntax of Stream Joins have changed from "$stream join $table" to "$stream => $table";
  the old syntax is accepted for compatibility but not generated. Other libraries
  should be updated to follow suit.
* The value type Builtin.ExampleProgram was removed. It was never meant for use
  outside of the Almond platform.
* Misc bug fixes [#11, #12].
* Build system and CI fixes.
* Dependencies have been updated.
